## Usage

`npx termi-clicker@latest` - install & play the game

> For now, global installing is not supported - the game will _probably_ work but the game's saving logic is assuming that it's inside `~/.npm/_npx/<temp_package_id>/`.
## Roadmap

Roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/users/golota60/projects/1/views/1?layout=board) - If you've got any ideas, feel free to open an issue where we can discuss it!

## Additional info

All the saves are currently saved inside the `.npm` directory - this might change in the future!

This package is devloped using node v14.17.0 - if any issues come up, please first check your node version!
